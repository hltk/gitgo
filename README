Gitgo: Go program for creating static web pages of git repositories.

This project started as a fork of stagit[1]. The basic structure of the code and
the interaction with the libgit2 api are from stagit.

The goal of the project is not to create the best possbile git web portal,
instead gitgo is intended to be a learning excercise of git and golang.

Requirements:
	- github.com/libgit2/git2go

Usage:
	1. Obtain a copy of this repo: git clone ..
	2. Build the progman: make
	3. When running the progman you have to give it two flags:
		3.1 -destdir indicates where the static pages are going
		    to be stored
		3.2 -installdir indicates where the git repo is stored in
		    the file system

	If there is a logo.png file in the installation directory, the
	program will detect it, and add it to every page.

License:
	Gitgo retains the MIT/X Consortium License of stagit.
