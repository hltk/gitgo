- larger goals:
	- add a way of generating the index page (a new binary? like stagit has)
		- the list of repos could have the last update date for every repo
		  and it could sort the list by that date

	- add better error handling
	- submodules are listed in .submodules
	- new file: add refs.html for branches and tags
- tree.html:
	- add last commit
	- add a link to parent folder

- index.html:
 - gather contributors (unique by email) and show their names
 - include the tree list above the readme
 - include number of commits next to log button

- branches.html
- tags.html

- log.html
 - include abbreviated hash for every commit
