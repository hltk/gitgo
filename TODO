- larger goals:
	- add a way of generating the index page (a new binary? like stagit has)
		- the list of repo's could have the last update date for every repo
		  and it could sort the list by that date

	- add better error handling
	- submodules are listed in .submodules
	- new file: add refs.html for branches and tags
- tree.html:
	- add last modification date
	- add last commit
	- add a link to parent folder
- linenumberer.html:
	- fix the tab character
- index.html:
	- make the LICENSE file easily accessible (the same way as README)
- footer.html:
	- add a time stamp indicating the page's creation time to every page
	- add a note "this page was generated using stagit" to the footer
- main.go
	- have the program throw an error when the installation directory isn't empty
